## Challenges

Each challenge starts off with a Google Drive link. 

The google drive will contain challenges (e.g. `challenge.txt`), files (e.g. `entry.pdf`), and [hints](#Hints) (e.g. `hint1.pdf`)

The challenge will end with a [**flag**](#Flag), which you will have to find. 

If a challenge has more than one [**flag**](#Flag), the password used to open each next entry are the additional flags, unless otherwise specified. 

## Flag

Each flag will be in the form of `PETCS{insert_flag_here}`. 

All flags will be in **all lowercase** *unless otherwise specified*. See each challenge for more detailed instructions. 

## Hints

Each challenge will contain zero or more hints. 

The hint gives a suggestion for how to approach or continue the challenge. 

Only look at thie hint if you are stuck/you need some help about how to continue. If you want a **challenge**, try not to use a hint. 

Hints will be released at intervals of 5-7 minutes. 

If you would like **a hint**, the password to open it will be found [here](hints.md) (if available).

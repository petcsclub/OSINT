# Example Challenge

## Challenge Description

Find the email and hotel of Mr. B. All we know is that his alias is THE4llANDP0werfu1MrB…. I hear he’s so eccentric he works with numbers in base 64!

## Solution 

- If we do a Google search for “THE4llANDP0werfu1MrB”, we get two results
- One result is a Reddit link, which in the profile portion has a base64 encoded link
- Using a base64 decoder, we can get the email
- The other result is an Instagram profile
- If we get the image of the only post (using inspect element), and reverse search the image on Google, we can get the name of the hotel
